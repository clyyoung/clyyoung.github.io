## Fabricating a smart question
As software engineers, we are expected to be driven and efficient problem solvers. Although the majority of the time we are hesitant to request help from others, there are always times when asking a question becomes unavoidable. When asking a question to other software engineers it is important to communicate the issue in a clear and concise way. This is done through asking smart questions. Being able to effectively communicate with others will result in answers that are satisfactory and helpful in solving the problem. Additionally, posing smart questions will project a thoughtful, competent, and courteous persona that will grab the attention of engineering peers.

A few of the most important methods to asking a smart question include doing research beforehand, taking the time to prepare, using correct grammar and formatting, being precise and informative, and stating the question explicitly. All of these techniques will produce a query that will attract the attention of other software engineers and lead to an answer that will effectively solve the issue. By ignoring these steps, it is extremely likely to not receive and answer at all.

From learning about asking smart questions, I was able to understand what is going through the minds of other engineers when they are reading certain questions. I never understood the science of asking a smart question, so discovering the different steps has given me the insight I need to be thoughtful and successful when asking questions.

## “Smart” and “not-so-smart” questions from StackOverflow
One of the smart questions asked on StackOverflow was requesting help on determining the difference between dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies in a Node Package Manager JSON file. The user also included relevant tags to this topic. When asking the question the user stated that he had read prior documentation regarding this topic and was still having difficulty understanding the differences. He continued on to request a simpler explanation or examples to help him out. This question fulfilled the precepts for a smart question because it showed competence through explaining the prior research, taking the time to think about what the issue was, using correct grammar and tags, asking the question explicitly, and being courteous to the other engineers. The responses reflect the smartness of this question because there were 17 total answers with 3082 upvotes on the accepted answer. Other engineers were eager to answer this question because it was asked in a smart way. This StackOverflow question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies).

On the other hand, one of the not smart questions on StackOverflow was asking others about where to bring up complaints about Google Store’s target API level restrictions. The user continued on to talk about an application that he had published and the complications that Google’s new policy is causing him. This question did not fulfill the precept for smart questions because it reflected incompetence through the lack of research, incorrect grammar, and the off-topic nature of the request on StackOverflow. The responses for this question show the lack of smartness because there were zero answers and only one comment made that discussed the irrelevance of the request for the StackOverflow forum. This question can be found at [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48122256/where-can-i-complain-about-google-store-target-api-level-restrictions).
