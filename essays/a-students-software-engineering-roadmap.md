## Pre-college history
The decision every young adult faces is what to do with their lives. I was no exception to this dilemma. After considering numerous different majors such as mathematics, architecture, and chemistry, I luckily discovered the world of software engineering. 

During my high school career, I found a love for math and science which ultimately led me to pursuing a future in engineering. Taking computer science classes and developing an interest in programming and the innovation of technology encouraged me to choose computer engineering as my major. 

## Entering the world of higher education
Starting at UH Manoa, I became determined to make the most of my college career. Through programming projects and various internships, my love for software engineering grew. One of my internships at the Naval Information Warfare Center challenged me to develop a motor inventory app. With that experience, I found that the process of designing and executing a useful tool for others was extremely rewarding. 

Throughout my time at UH Manoa, I also found a passion for the aerospace field. I joined the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) Aerospace Technologies in the beginning of my sophomore year and have continued supporting the satellite project. The goal of the satellite project is to be the first satellite built in Hawaii to take a picture of the Hawaiian Islands from space. Within the VIP team, I was a lead for the On-Board Computer and Communications subsystems and eventually became the Project Manager. Continuing my love for space, I accepted a position as a Satellite Software Assistant for the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL). Through this job I was able to work on the software and avionics for HSFLâ€™s Artemis CubeSat Kit whose mission is to develop an educational low-cost 1U CubeSat kit. This past summer I also interned for Northrop Grumman as an Electronics Engineer. I was able to gain experience in FPGA development as well as printed circuit board testing. Experiencing all of these different space-related projects only solidified my desire to pursue a career in the aerospace industry.

## Post-college and beyond
Following graduation, I am looking forward to beginning my career as a Systems Engineer for Northrop Grumman. Through this job I hope to continue developing my problem solving, communication, leadership, and technical skills. The fortunate experiences that I have had in college were able to set me up for success in entering the workforce. I hope this job will be a stepping stone for a promising career in systems and software engineering.
