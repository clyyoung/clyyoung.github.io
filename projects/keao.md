Ke Ao is a 1U CubeSat developed by the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) Aerospace Technologies class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The main goal of this project is to create a functional, low cost satellite to take a picture of the Hawaiian Islands from space. The secondary goal for this project is to be able to demonstrate that it is possible for a CubeSat to be manufactured for under $10,000, whereas typical CubeSats can cost upwards of $100,000. To accomplish this goal, a mixture of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and in-house electrical and mechanical components are used to reduce the overall cost.  A number of these components are designed, built and tested in the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL). This project was first started in Fall 2019 and the team, Team Laniakea, is currently pushing for a launch in Fall 2023.

Throughout this project I have had numerous roles ranging from on-board computer (OBC) and communications leads to project manager. As an OBC lead, I helped to direct the software for the satellite’s computer in addition to fabricating the hardware. As the communications subsystem lead I worked with the global network SatNOGS to connect the ground station to the satellite. My main role as the team’s current project manager is to keep the team on task to be able to meet deadlines and to ensure project progress. I also oversee budget and procurement alongside the fiscal manager. 

This project has been the most challenging yet rewarding endeavor I have worked on. I started out not having many skills and being confused with my tasks to eventually gaining the tools needed to do the jobs assigned to me. I was able to get a better understanding of how software gets integrated into bigger projects, refine my soldering and PCB assembly skills, and develop my leadership and communication skills.
